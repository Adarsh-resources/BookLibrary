		<h1>WELCOME TO THE NEW BOOK STORE</h1>
		<h6>Great literature has gifted us some of the most meaningful
			and timeless quotes about life, love, and everything in between.
			Writers can put words to the feelings and experiences we can't quite
			capture ourselves and leave us with quotes that resonate long after
			we've turned the page. Readers have found moving quotes in everything
			from gothic classics to contemporary young adult reads. Sometimes,
			we're inspired by a quote that we didn't even know came from a book.
			I've heard "Not all those who wander are lost" countless times but
			never knew it was from a beloved fantasy series. To create this list,
			I looked at some of the most memorable and moving quotes from
			literature throughout time. For readers looking for a new
			inspirational read or wondering where some of the greatest lines
			originated from, here are some of the best literary quotes and the
			books they came from.</h6>
